# AGENT.md

## Project State

**Status**: Prototyping & experimentation phase

**Files**:
- `index.ts` - Legacy implementation. Plain proxy using Bun TCP API for CONNECT tunneling.
- `serve.ts` - Current main implementation. Experimenting with dynamic TLS cert generation per domain.

Both files kept for comparison/reference during prototyping.

## AI Agent Instructions

When working on this codebase:

**Output style**:
- Keep responses concise - sacrifice grammar for brevity
- Keep MD files concise
- Summarize actions in single sentence

**Working style**:
- Expect rapid iteration & experimentation
- Both implementations may evolve or be replaced
- Don't over-engineer - prototype quality expected
